					<h2>The Shallow Sea</h2>
					<h3 class="subtitle">Epipelagic Zone</h3>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Most of the biomass of the ocean lives here, in the uppermost 200 meters of the ocean, where sunlight powers the food chain. Humans lump everything below here under the term “deep sea.” Even in scuba gear, we can’t dive deeper than 100 meters safely.</p>
						<p>This limitation has colored our perception of the ocean. For millennia, we’ve been oblivious to that which we could neither see nor touch. Two thousand years ago, Rome’s famous naturalist, Pliny, said, “The deep sea is an inferior world. All we know of it is all there is to be known.” A cocksure declaration coming from an animal who could, at best, dive no deeper than the bottom of your browser window.</p>
						<p>Keep diving and see just how “barren” the deep really is.</p>

					<h2>Welcome to the Twilight Zone</h2>
					<h3 class="subtitle">Mesopelagic</h3>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Over half of all species of sharks live here, below 200 meters. No photosynthesis can happen here. Most of the sunlight has been filtered out already, starting with the longer wavelengths, the reds and oranges. But there’s still plenty to eat. The creatures you encounter from here on are all scavengers, hunters, or play host to bacteria that get their energy from a process called chemosynthesis.</p>
						<p>It’s a world very much unlike our own, a world once thought to be inhospitable to life as we know it. We are about to glimpse what life could be like on another planet.</p>

					<h3>Flashlight Fish</h3>
					<div class="facts">
						<p>Flashlight fish are a tropical species that sometimes comes out of the deep at night. They have a bioluminescent pocket under their eye they use to communicate with each other, disorient predators, and hunt.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="challenge">
						<p>Oh no! This little flashlight fish is having trouble keeping up with the others. Use your browser’s dev tools to unpause its swimming animation so it can catch up.</p>
					</div>
					<img src="img/fish-test.png" />
				</div>
				<div class="segment right" id="d600">
					<h3>Nautilus</h3>
					<div class="facts">
						<p>There were once six families of Nautilaceae. But only one made it out of the Triassic. Here, 600 meters deep, modern descendants of these prehistoric molluscs still prowl. Other cephalopods like octopi have eight arms, but a nautilus can have ninety or so.</p>
						<p>Nautili are long-lived for cephalopods, taking fifteen years to reach sexual maturity. Yet their shells are popular as curiosities and in jewelry, where they are made into bluish “Osmeña Pearls” Harvesting is unregulated most likely unsustainable. It is possible for an animal who outlived the dinosaurs to finally be driven extinct in the name of human vanity.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="challenge">
						<p>Nautili get around using jet propulsion. This coupled with their buoyant, air-filled shells, gives them their characteristic bobbing motion as they move through the water.</p>
						<p>These nautili are moving a little too smoothly through the water. Use your browser’s dev tools to adjust their easing to look more natural.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="segment top" id="d800">
					<h3>Humboldt Squid</h3>
					<div class="challenge">
						<p>When Humboldt squid feed, they rapidly flash from white to red. Scientists think they might actually be flashing as a form of camouflage or to disorient their prey.</p>
						<p>These squid are on the hunt! But how are they changing colors so quickly? Use the animation playback controls to slow down their flashing and see what's really happening.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="facts">
						<p>The chromatophores on the Humboldt’s body change color too rapidly for the human eye to perceive. There coloration and aggressive feeding behavior have earned them the nickname “red devils” with Mexican fishermen.</p>
						<p>These squid can form huge shoals of over 1000 individuals. They take only a year to grow to full size, and that fast growth means a big appetite.</p>
						<p>Recently, this species has started spreading northward as far as the coast of Oregon in the United States. If the thought of armies of aggro squid invading your coastline keeps you up at night, take heart: although Humboldts do migrate toward the surface at night to hunt, you’re unlikely to ever encounter one. The upward limit of their migration, 130 meters below the surface, is well below the depth of unassisted divers.</p>

					<h2>The Midnight Zone</h2>

						<p>Darker than dark. Blacker than black. Even a moonless night sky has the stars, but here, even on the sunniest day, not a single ray of light reaches.</p>
						<p>There is little oxygen. The temperature hovers near freezing.</p>

					<h3>Orange roughy</h3>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Why is this fish black when its name is “orange?” Orange roughy can be found in the blue-lit waters of the Twilight Zone, where red light is filtered. Its red pigments look black, helping it blend into the deep.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="challenge">
						<p>To see how the Orange Roughy gets its name, use your dev tool’s element inspector to edit the fish’s custom CSS filter. This filter screens out all of fish’s red hues, just like ocean water would. Try removing it then adding a greyscale filter to see how the two differ.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="facts">
						<p>Red wavelengths are the first part of the color spectrum to be filtered out by water. In other words, the deeper you go, the bluer things get. Many fish in the deep are bright red in broad daylight, but look black down here because there's no red light for them to reflect. (Why don’t you check out how the Humboldt squid look with the filter off?)</p>

				<div class="segment focus" id="d1800">
					<div class="content">
						<p>Many deep sea fish have slow metabolism which makes for a long life. Originally the Orange Roughy was thought to live to about 20 years. The adults spawn in large groups over underwater mountain tops called seamounts. Catch quotas were set with the expectation that young fish would mature over 20 years to fill in for the caught fish. Fisheries trawled these breeding grounds repeatedly, hauling up hundreds of thousands of tons spawning fish.</p>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="segment focus" id="d2000">
					<div class="content">
						<p>Then scientists discovered that the fish actually live to 150 years of age.</p>

						<p>Orange Roughy stocks around the world collapsed. Too few new fish were joining the spawning grounds. The catch rates exceed the rate at which the fish can repopulate.</p>

						<p>To this day the future of the Orange Roughy remains uncertain.</p>

					<h3>Deep Sea Disco</h3>
					<div class="content">
						<p>Just because it’s dark down here doesn’t mean the party has to stop. Many creatures down here create their own light. But it often requires special optics to pic up film.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="challenge">
						<p>A little dark down here, isn’t it? “Calibrate” your screen to view the disco scene. Sample the flashlight fish's bioluminescent patch from before to “turn on” the underwater light show.</p>
					</div>
					<div class="facts">
						<p>Deep sea creatures use their own light to communicate, hunt, mate, and escape one another. The deep may be a quiet plays, but it is lousy with light noise from tiny plankton to glowing coral.</p>
						<p>Bioluminescence can be produced three ways:</p>
						<ul>
							<li>Harboring symbiotic bacteria</li>
							<li>Creating bioluminescent chemicals</li>
							<li>Eating bioluminescent creatures and using their chemicals.</li>

						<p>Welcome to the Abyssal Plain. It is wide, flat, and coated in a thick, grey ooze. This ooze comes from what is colorfully referred to as “marine snow”: the leftovers that constantly float down from sunnier waters.</p>
						<p>The pressure here is intense. Most abyssal creatures have flabby, gelatinous bodies that explode when brought to the surface. Few fish live here, and those that do are often very small and very efficient.</p>
						<p>On the bright side, if you like to eat grey ooze, living down here is fairly easy. And many soft, squishy creatures do just that. The ancient hagfish doesn’t seem to mind the ooze or the pressure.</p>
